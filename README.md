# Witness Puzzles

## Bugs

1. Finishes in cylinder puzzles are not correctly computing valid directions.

## TODO

### Flesh out this README document.

1. Start with an itroduction describing the game, the purpose of this app, and the rationale for developing it.
1. Next a description of the puzzles, the puzzle types, and their elements.
1. Then a description of the interface to the program and how to use it.
1. Finally a description of the implementation and some acknowledgements.

### Functional

1. Complete the implementation of the tetris icon type.
1. Make an icon for the app.
1. Can the IconType enum be eliminated by type introspection?

### GUI

1. The sliders on the properties sheet are horrible.  They are difficult to see and hence use.  There must be a way to make them better.
1. Need a better way to highlight the active tool in the tool bar.
1. Someone suggested that the properties sheet should live update the window below.  Investigate how to do this if possible.
